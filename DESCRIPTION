Description: Provides tools to assists with spatial analysis of Research Vessel and Landings data in the Gulf Region. Several functions are tailored for use with package `sdmTMB` (See Anderson et al. (2024) <doi:10.1101/2022.03.24.485545>.)
    Other functions that do not require `sdmTMB` are useful for more general spatial applications.
